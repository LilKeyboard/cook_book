Boil water in a kettle or on a stove.
Place the tea bag or loose leaf tea into a tea infuser or strainer.
Pour the hot water over the tea bag or loose leaf tea in a cup.
Let the tea steep for 3-5 minutes, or until it reaches the desired strength.
Remove the tea bag or infuser/strainer and discard the used tea leaves.
If desired, add sweeteners such as honey, sugar, or milk to the tea.
Enjoy your cup of tea!
